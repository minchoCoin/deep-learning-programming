# deep-learning-programming
The assignments of 'Deep Learning Programming' lecture (2024 autumn)

All labs contains 
- pre-report: summarizing papers
- ipynb files : implemented algorithm with Pytorch
- final report : analyzing results

All reports are written in English except pre-report of Lab1.

We use latex([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)) and [BMVC Paper Templates](https://github.com/BritishMachineVisionAssociation/BMVCTemplate) for writing report.
